            It's never too early or too late to start working your way towards the healthiest version of yourself!
            Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well being. Here at LOOP we focus on all three
            aspects. Our training concept is designed to make you move more, not lift heavier - keeping you fit, not
            big. And our post-workout social gatherings where we offer free coffee and tea and a cozy environment
            for you to meet new people are the perfect opportunity for you to become a part of our community.

            LOOP's circular training concept ensures a well-balanced whole-body workout in just 24 minutes. The
            training consists of a unique combination of exercises that are performed on 16 fitness machines set up
            in a circle. The machines together provide an effective training of both muscle strength and fitness. 24
            minutes is only two rounds in the circle which is enough activity to boost fat burning and help you get
            in shape.
